# Glasgow NLP Kubernetes configuration

This repo is meant to be a common dump for everyone who ~~stares at the abyss~~ tries to configure a Kubernetes cluster by the University of Glasgow.

What you'll find here:

- my pod configurations
- my route and service configurations
- an example docker file (not required, you can easily use a publicly available one)

You'll also find a similar pod configuration for GCP Kubernetes Engine.
